        <h2>You win:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealer's hand value</li>
            <li>By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21.</li>
            <li>By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Dealer wins:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your hand value exceeds 21.</li>
            <li>The dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Playing:</h2>
        <p>To start, the player and the dealer will have 2 cards. However you can only see one of the dealers cards. The player must then<br> decide whether they want another card (HIT Button) or if they would like to remain with the cards they have (STAND
            Button).
            <br> The reset button will restart the game.</p>
